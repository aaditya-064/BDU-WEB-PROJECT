        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>
          Buddha Dana Udhyog Pvt. Ltd., a leading name in the feed industry
          since 2058 B.S. Under the visionary leadership of our Managing
          Director, Mr. Bindu Lal Shrestha, we have evolved from our humble
          beginnings as Buddha Dana Udhyog to become a trusted provider of
          premium feed products.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our extensive product range includes specialized feeds for chickens,
          fish, cattle, and pigs, catering to the diverse needs of the
          agricultural sector. We proudly offer our products under three
          renowned brands: Shraddha, Srijan, and Saurya. For poultry, we provide
          tailored feeds for broilers, layers, and Giriraj chickens, ensuring
          optimal nutrition and growth.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our facilities boast advanced technology, including a state-of-the-art
          broiler plant that utilizes 100% pure mineral water to generate steam,
          upholding the highest standards of hygiene and quality in our
          production process. Additionally, we operate nine well-maintained
          ponds dedicated to fish hatching, demonstrating our commitment to
          sustainable aquaculture.
        </p>

        <p>
          Beyond our core business, we believe in fostering a balanced
          lifestyle. Our premises include a futsal ground, offering a space for
          relaxation and entertainment for our employees and the community.
        </p>
